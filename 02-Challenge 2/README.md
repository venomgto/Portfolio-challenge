# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

For this challenge, I was tasked to complete a portfolio show casing the projects I had, as well as showing my skills and knowledge with Html and Css. while doing the challange I included a picture of myself, also added navagation links. I don't have any projects right now but I added random pictures in the mean time. I also provided contact info for futures employers to be able to contact me. I also added a hover effect to the images. I also tried using the media screen to be able to re-size the window, so no matter what device the user is using they will still be a le to acess the webiste with no issues
